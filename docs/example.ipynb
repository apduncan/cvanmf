    "#### Background\n",
    "$L1$ regularisation can be applied to encourage sparsity in the decomposition (fewer entries in $W$ and $H$ with high values).\n",
    "A sparse solution can have benefits for intuitive understanding, for instance if we are decomposing a table of genes, a signature with high weights for a few genes, rather than lower weights for many genes, can be easier to interpret biologically. \n",
    "\n",
    "$L2$ regularisation instead encourages a more even distribution of weights across in both $W$ and $H$, leading to more evenly distributed weights and lower sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of regularisation is controlled by two parameters, $l1\\_ratio$ and $alpha$ from the underlying NMF implementation we use from `scikit-learn`. Currently regularisation is applied to both the $H$ and $W$ matrices, though `sklearn` supports only applying to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $l1\\_ratio$ - Between 0 and 1, with 1 applying only $L1$ regularisation, and 0 applying only $L2$ regularisation, and any value between being a mix.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "We give an example here of $L1$ regularisation to encourage sparsity. `cvanmf` provides the function `regu_selection` to test values of $alpha$ for a given $l1\\_ratio$. As we want a sparse solution, we will use $l1\\_ratio = 1$. The function only accepts one rank, we have to have already selected the rank of decomposition we want."
